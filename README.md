# 60DaysOfPython â€” Week 1: Foundations & Data Analysis

A focused, practical restart of Python fundamentals and core data-analysis skills. This repository contains notes, exercises, coding challenges, and a small end-of-week project to rebuild confidence and produce portfolio-ready work for job applications.

## Motivation

I completed a master's project using an external AI assistant (Claude) and used AI to help build my resume. While preparing applications I felt gaps in my practical Python skills. This series is a deliberate, hands-on restart: build fundamentals, practice applied data work, and produce clean, well-documented code to show on GitHub.

## Week 1 Goals

- Master Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Practice list comprehensions, generators, and decorators
- Learn OOP fundamentals: classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Implement NumPy basics: arrays, broadcasting, and common operations
- Deep dive into Pandas: data cleaning, aggregation, and transformations
- Solve 20 HackerRank Python problems (practice & algorithmic thinking)
- Complete 10 NumPy coding challenges (numerical manipulation)
- Clean and document 3 messy datasets
- Week 1 Final Project: build an end-to-end data-analysis pipeline from raw data to insights
- Publish clean, documented code and notebooks on GitHub
